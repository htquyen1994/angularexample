/**
 * @name MarkerClustererOptions
 * @class This class represents the optional parameter passed to
 *  the {@link MarkerClusterer} constructor.
 * @property {number} [gridSize=60] The grid size of a cluster in pixels. The grid is a square.
 * @property {number} [maxZoom=null] The maximum zoom level at which clustering is enabled or
 *  <code>null</code> if clustering is to be enabled at all zoom levels.
 * @property {boolean} [zoomOnClick=true] Whether to zoom the map when a cluster marker is
 *  clicked. You may want to set this to <code>false</code> if you have installed a handler
 *  for the <code>click</code> event and it deals with zooming on its own.
 * @property {boolean} [averageCenter=false] Whether the position of a cluster marker should be
 *  the average position of all markers in the cluster. If set to <code>false</code>, the
 *  cluster marker is positioned at the location of the first marker added to the cluster.
 * @property {number} [minimumClusterSize=2] The minimum number of markers needed in a cluster
 *  before the markers are hidden and a cluster marker appears.
 * @property {boolean} [ignoreHidden=false] Whether to ignore hidden markers in clusters. You
 *  may want to set this to <code>true</code> to ensure that hidden markers are not included
 *  in the marker count that appears on a cluster marker (this count is the value of the
 *  <code>text</code> property of the result returned by the default <code>calculator</code>).
 *  If set to <code>true</code> and you change the visibility of a marker being clustered, be
 *  sure to also call <code>MarkerClusterer.repaint()</code>.
 * @property {string} [title=""] The tooltip to display when the mouse moves over a cluster
 *  marker. (Alternatively, you can use a custom <code>calculator</code> function to specify a
 *  different tooltip for each cluster marker.)
 * @property {function} [calculator=MarkerClusterer.CALCULATOR] The function used to determine
 *  the text to be displayed on a cluster marker and the index indicating which style to use
 *  for the cluster marker. The input parameters for the function are (1) the array of markers
 *  represented by a cluster marker and (2) the number of cluster icon styles. It returns a
 *  {@link ClusterIconInfo} object. The default <code>calculator</code> returns a
 *  <code>text</code> property which is the number of markers in the cluster and an
 *  <code>index</code> property which is one higher than the lowest integer such that
 *  <code>10^i</code> exceeds the number of markers in the cluster, or the size of the styles
 *  array, whichever is less. The <code>styles</code> array element used has an index of
 *  <code>index</code> minus 1. For example, the default <code>calculator</code> returns a
 *  <code>text</code> value of <code>"125"</code> and an <code>index</code> of <code>3</code>
 *  for a cluster icon representing 125 markers so the element used in the <code>styles</code>
 *  array is <code>2</code>. A <code>calculator</code> may also return a <code>title</code>
 *  property that contains the text of the tooltip to be used for the cluster marker. If
 *   <code>title</code> is not defined, the tooltip is set to the value of the <code>title</code>
 *   property for the MarkerClusterer.
 * @property {string} [clusterClass="cluster"] The name of the CSS class defining general styles
 *  for the cluster markers. Use this class to define CSS styles that are not set up by the code
 *  that processes the <code>styles</code> array.
 * @property {Array} [styles] An array of {@link ClusterIconStyle} elements defining the styles
 *  of the cluster markers to be used. The element to be used to style a given cluster marker
 *  is determined by the function defined by the <code>calculator</code> property.
 *  The default is an array of {@link ClusterIconStyle} elements whose properties are derived
 *  from the values for <code>imagePath</code>, <code>imageExtension</code>, and
 *  <code>imageSizes</code>.
 * @property {boolean} [enableRetinaIcons=false] Whether to allow the use of cluster icons that
 * have sizes that are some multiple (typically double) of their actual display size. Icons such
 * as these look better when viewed on high-resolution monitors such as Apple's Retina displays.
 * Note: if this property is <code>true</code>, sprites cannot be used as cluster icons.
 * @property {number} [batchSize=MarkerClusterer.BATCH_SIZE] Set this property to the
 *  number of markers to be processed in a single batch when using a browser other than
 *  Internet Explorer (for Internet Explorer, use the batchSizeIE property instead).
 * @property {number} [batchSizeIE=MarkerClusterer.BATCH_SIZE_IE] When Internet Explorer is
 *  being used, markers are processed in several batches with a small delay inserted between
 *  each batch in an attempt to avoid Javascript timeout errors. Set this property to the
 *  number of markers to be processed in a single batch; select as high a number as you can
 *  without causing a timeout error in the browser. This number might need to be as low as 100
 *  if 15,000 markers are being managed, for example.
 * @property {string} [imagePath=MarkerClusterer.IMAGE_PATH]
 *  The full URL of the root name of the group of image files to use for cluster icons.
 *  The complete file name is of the form <code>imagePath</code>n.<code>imageExtension</code>
 *  where n is the image file number (1, 2, etc.).
 * @property {string} [imageExtension=MarkerClusterer.IMAGE_EXTENSION]
 *  The extension name for the cluster icon image files (e.g., <code>"png"</code> or
 *  <code>"jpg"</code>).
 * @property {Array} [imageSizes=MarkerClusterer.IMAGE_SIZES]
 *  An array of numbers containing the widths of the group of
 *  <code>imagePath</code>n.<code>imageExtension</code> image files.
 *  (The images are assumed to be square.)
